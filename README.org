* Breaking Changes :noexport:

- [18 January 2022] Package name change from Org-marginalia to Org-remark. See [[https://github.com/nobiot/org-remark/issues/11#issuecomment-1382824948][detail on data conversion]]. In most cases, no action is required for you.

* Introduction

Org-remark lets you highlight and annotate text files, websites, EPUB books and Info documentation with using Org mode.

A user manual is available [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-remark/][online]] or Emacs in-system as an Info node `(org-remark)': (~C-h i~ and find the =Org-remark= node).

For installation and minimum configuration, refer to [[#installation][Installation]] below or the user manual: [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-remark/#Installation][online]] or Info node `(org-remark) Installation'

Getting Started in the user manual will get you started in 5 minutes: [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-remark/#Getting-Started][online]] or or Info node `(org-remark) Getting Started'.

For customization, refer to the customization group `org-remark' or user manual: [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-remark/#Customizing][online]] or Info node `(org-remark) Customizing'. A [[https://github.com/nobiot/org-remark/tree/main/docs/articles/2023-08-20T184309_C_how-to-set-icons-to-be-svg-images.md][separate online article]] has been written to guide you on how to customize an icon (also part of the user manual. Evaluate (info "(or-gremark) How to Set Org-remark to Use SVG Icons").

An [[https://youtu.be/c8DHrAsFiLc][introductory video]] (8 minutes) and [[https://youtu.be/BTFuS21N00k][V1.1.0 release introduction]] (12 minutes) are available on YouTube.

* Features

- Highlight and annotate any text file. The highlights and notes are kept in an Org file as the plain text database. This lets you easily manage your marginal notes and use the built-in Org facilities on them -- e.g. create a sparse tree based on the category of the notes

- Create your your own highlighter pens with different colors, type (e.g. underline, squiggle, etc. optionally with Org's category for search and filter on your highlights and notes)

- Have the same highlighting and annotating functionality for

  + Websites when you use EWW to browse them

  + EPUB books with [[https://depp.brause.cc/nov.el/][nov.el]]

  + Info documentation

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installation
:END:

This package is available on:

- [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/org-remark.html][GNU-ELPA]] (releases only; equivalent to MELPA-Stable)
- [[https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/org-remark.html][GNU-devel ELPA]] (unreleased main branch; equivalent to MELPA)

GNU ELPA should be already set up in your Emacs by default. If you wish to add GNU-devel ELPA, simply add its URL to ~package-archives~ like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("gnu-devel" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/") :append)
#+END_SRC

After installation, we suggest you put the setup below in your configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (org-remark-global-tracking-mode +1)

  ;; Optional if you would like to highlight websites via eww-mode
  (with-eval-after-load 'eww
    (org-remark-eww-mode +1))

  ;; Optional if you would like to highlight EPUB books via nov.el
  (with-eval-after-load 'nov
    (org-remark-nov-mode +1))

  ;; Optional if you would like to highlight Info documentation via Info-mode
  (with-eval-after-load 'info
    (org-remark-info-mode +1))
#+end_src

Unless you explicitly load ~org~ during Emacs initialization, I suggest to defer loading ~org-remark~ (thus there is no ~(require 'org-remark)~ in the example above). This is because it will also pull in ~org~, which can slow down initialization. You can control the timing of loading ~org-remark~ by autoloading some commands in a similar way with the example keybindings below.

Below are example keybindings you might like to consider:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Key-bind `org-remark-mark' to global-map so that you can call it
  ;; globally before the library is loaded.

  (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c n m") #'org-remark-mark)

  ;; The rest of keybidings are done only on loading `org-remark'
  (with-eval-after-load 'org-remark
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n o") #'org-remark-open)
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n ]") #'org-remark-view-next)
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n [") #'org-remark-view-prev)
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n r") #'org-remark-remove)
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n d") #'org-remark-delete))
#+end_src

Alternatively, you can use ~use-package~ to set up Org-remark. The example provided below should be equivalent to the setup described above.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-remark
    :bind (;; :bind keyword also implicitly defers org-remark itself.
           ;; Keybindings before :map is set for global-map.
           ("C-c n m" . org-remark-mark)
           ("C-c n l" . org-remark-mark-line)
           :map org-remark-mode-map
           ("C-c n o" . org-remark-open)
           ("C-c n ]" . org-remark-view-next)
           ("C-c n [" . org-remark-view-prev)
           ("C-c n r" . org-remark-remove)
           ("C-c n d" . org-remark-delete))
    ;; Alternative way to enable `org-remark-global-tracking-mode' in
    ;; `after-init-hook'.
    ;; :hook (after-init . org-remark-global-tracking-mode)
    :init
    ;; It is recommended that `org-remark-global-tracking-mode' be
    ;; enabled when Emacs initializes. Alternatively, you can put it to
    ;; `after-init-hook' as in the comment above
    (org-remark-global-tracking-mode +1)
    :config
    (use-package org-remark-info :after info :config (org-remark-info-mode +1))
    (use-package org-remark-eww  :after eww  :config (org-remark-eww-mode +1))
    (use-package org-remark-nov  :after nov  :config (org-remark-nov-mode +1)))
#+end_src
