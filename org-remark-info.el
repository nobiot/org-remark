;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  This file is an Org-remark extension to add highlights and
;;  annotation support for Info-mode.
;;
;;  The extension can be enabled globally with `org-remark-info-mode'
;;
;;  Highlights will include the links to the original with using
;;  `ol-info' (Org mode's info: link type). By default, it opens the
;;  node within the same window as the Org buffer, which is not
;;  convenient for the purpose of Org-remark. You can configure Emacs to
;;  open info: link into another window. See an example of such a
;;  customization below:
;;
;;    (setopt switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions t)
;;    (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
;;               '("\*info\*.*"
;;                 (display-buffer-reuse-mode-window)
;;                 (mode . Info-mode)))
;;
;;  You will need to use `org-remark-info-mode' in conjunction with
;;  `org-remark-global-tracking-mode' and `org-remark-mode'. For more,
;;  refer to the following Info node:
;;
;; - Info node `(org-remark) Installation'
;; - Info node `(org-remark) Getting Started'
