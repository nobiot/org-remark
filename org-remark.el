;;;; Minor mode

;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode org-remark-mode
    "Highlight and annotate any text file with using Org mode.
This is a local minor-mode.

On activation, it loads your saved highlights from the notes file
and enables automatic saving of highlights thereafter.

The automatic saving is achieved via function
`org-remark-save' added to `after-save-hook'.

On deactivation, it removes all the overlays and stops tracking
the highlights in this buffer by setting variable
`org-remark-highlights' to nil.  Be careful of behavior, if
you still wish to retain the locations of highlights.

It is recommended to use `org-remark-toggle' if you wish to
temporarily hide highlights in the current buffer.  It keeps
`org-remark-highlights' unchanged.

While the tracking of highlights is stopped,
editing the buffer will likely result in mismatch between the
saved highlights' locations and the current buffer's text
content.

Highlights tracked by variable `org-remark-highlights' cannot
persist when you kill the buffer or quit Emacs.  When you
re-launch Emacs and visit the same file, ensure to turn on
`org-remark-mode' to load the highlights from the marginalia
file.  `org-remark-global-tracking-mode' automates this.  It is
recommended to turn it on as part of Emacs initialization.

create a new H1 headline for it at the bottom of the marginal
notes buffer with TITLE as its headline text.

When called for a new highlight that is unsaved in the marginal
notes file, this function will create a new H2 headline with the
highlighted text as its headline text at the end of the H1
headline for the source buffer.

If a headline with the same ID already exists, update its
position and properties named \"org-remark-*\" and CATEGORY from
the highlight overlay.  For update, the headline text will be
kept intact, because the user might have changed it to their
needs.

This function will also add a normal file link as property
\"org-remark-link\" of the H2 headline entry, pointing back to
the source file with search option \"::line-number\", or for
non-file sources, calls `run-hook-with-args-until-success' for
`org-remark-highlight-link-to-source-functions' with FILENAME as
the argument.

ORGID can be passed to this function.  If user option
`org-remark-use-org-id' is non-nil, this function will add an
Org-ID link in the body text of the headline, linking back to the
source with using ORGID.

When the current source buffer is not set up for sync with notes,
this function calls `org-remark-notes-setup' to prepare the notes
buffer for automatic sync."

;;;;; org-remark-notes
;;    Private functions that work on marginal notes buffer (notes
;;    buffer).  Notes buffer visits an Org file, which serves as plain
;;    text database whose main purpose is to persist the location of
;;    highlights and body text for them if any. Each highlight can also
;;    hold properties related to Org-remark.  Their names are prefixed
;;    with "org-remark".  The exception to this is the Org's standard
;;    CATEGORY, which can be set as a property for Org-remark's custom
;;    highlighter pens.

;;    The tree structure of the Org file database can be flexible and
;;    defined per major mode by their respective extension. Examples
;;    include `org-remark-nov' and `org-remark-info'. Org-remark search
;;    specific Org properties to determine where to store newly created
;;    highlights. :org-remark-file: and :org-remark-id: are the most
;;    important properties that Org-remark search.

;;    - The default tree structure:

;;        H1: File (:org-remark-file:) for non-file visiting buffer, file
;;            name equivalent such as URL for a website

;;        H2: Highlight (:org-remark-id:) each one has a dedicated H2
;;            subtree

;;   - The tree structure for `org-remark-nov'

;;        H1: Book (:org-remark-nov-file:) The EPUB file, which
;;            is the zip file.

;;        H2: Chapter (:org-remark-file:) Each HTML file contained in
;;            the EPUB file

;;        H3: Highlight (:org-remark-id:)

;;    The highlight (:org-remark-id:) is the lowest level of the tree,
;;    whose parent/ancestor must be a node that has :org-remark-file:
;;    property.

;;    In general, -notes-* functions assume the current buffer is the
;;    notes buffer.  One remark on a subtlety: Org-remark clones an
;;    indirect buffer of notes buffer; this is meant to be user
;;    convenience. Users might interact with either the indirect buffer
;;    or directly with the base buffer.  For automatic sync
;;    functionality, Org-remark interacts directly with the base buffer.
